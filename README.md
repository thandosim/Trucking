# Overview

As a software engineer, I want to develop my skills for developing applications for mobile 
devices to solve real world problems. 

This app is for businesses that use external truking services to recieve or ship out goods. 
It is also for transport operators because it allows them to easily find cargo that needs to 
be transported. 
To use the app, ine must log in (username: admin, password: 1234). After logging in the user 
must select find a truck if they are a business to looking to transport goods, or find goods 
if they are a transport company looking for customers.

I created this app to develop my skills as a software engineer. It showcases my ability to 
learn new languages and adapt to new environments. It also showcases my abilty to take an idea 
and develop a functioning application to solve a real world problem. In this case, the problem 
was given to me by a business person who was worried about the amount of time he has to spend
looking for transport for his goods. 
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
